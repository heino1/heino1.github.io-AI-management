# NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)

## Overview
The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) is a comprehensive approach to managing risks associated with artificial intelligence systems. Published in January 2023, it provides organizations with a structured methodology to identify, assess, and mitigate AI-related risks.

## Key Characteristics of AI Risks

AI risks can be characterized as:
- Long-term or short-term
- High or low probability
- Systemic or localized
- High or low impact

## Unique Challenges of AI Risk Management

AI systems pose unique risk management challenges compared to traditional software systems:
- AI systems may be trained on data that can change over time
- Systems can change significantly and unexpectedly
- AI functionality and trustworthiness can be affected in ways that are hard to understand
- AI systems and their deployment contexts are frequently complex
- Difficult to detect and respond to failures when they occur
- AI systems are inherently socio-technical in nature
- Risks emerge from the interplay of technical aspects with societal factors

## Core Framework Functions

The AI RMF organizes risk management activities into four key functions:

### 1. Govern
- Cross-cutting function that informs and is infused throughout the other three functions
- Establishes governance structures and processes
- Defines risk management policies and procedures
- Ensures alignment with organizational values and objectives

### 2. Map
- Identifies and documents contexts where AI systems will operate
- Determines potential risks and impacts
- Analyzes how AI systems might affect individuals, communities, and society

### 3. Measure
- Quantifies and qualifies AI risks
- Establishes metrics and measurement methodologies
- Evaluates risk levels against organizational tolerance thresholds

### 4. Manage
- Implements risk mitigation strategies
- Prioritizes actions based on risk assessments
- Monitors ongoing effectiveness of controls

## Characteristics of Trustworthy AI Systems

The framework identifies several key characteristics of trustworthy AI systems:

1. **Valid & Reliable** - A necessary foundation for trustworthiness
2. **Safe** - Systems designed to avoid harm
3. **Secure & Resilient** - Protected against threats and able to recover from disruptions
4. **Accountable & Transparent** - Clear responsibility and visibility into operations
5. **Explainable & Interpretable** - Decisions can be understood and explained
6. **Privacy-Enhanced** - Protects personal and sensitive information
7. **Fair with Harmful Bias Managed** - Minimizes discriminatory outcomes

## Responsible AI Practices

Core concepts in responsible AI emphasize:
- Human centricity
- Social responsibility
- Sustainability

AI risk management drives responsible uses and practices by prompting organizations to think critically about:
- Context and potential impacts
- Unexpected negative and positive outcomes
- Enhancing trustworthiness and public trust

## Implementation Approach

The AI RMF is designed to be:
- Flexible and adaptable to different organizational contexts
- Applicable across the AI lifecycle
- Compatible with existing risk management frameworks
- Usable by organizations of all sizes and sectors

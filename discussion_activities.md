# AI Management, Risk Management, and Governance
## Discussion Questions and Activities

This document provides discussion questions and interactive activities that can be used during or after the presentation to engage the audience and deepen understanding of key concepts.

## Discussion Questions

### AI Management

1. How does AI strategy differ from traditional technology strategy in your organization or industry?

2. What are the most significant challenges in building effective cross-functional AI teams? How can these challenges be addressed?

3. How should organizations balance the need for specialized AI expertise with the importance of domain knowledge?

4. What metrics are most important for evaluating AI performance in your specific context? How do these differ from traditional performance metrics?

5. How can organizations effectively manage the transition from pilot AI projects to enterprise-wide implementation?

### AI Risk Management

1. What are the most significant AI risks in your industry or organization? How are these risks currently being managed?

2. How can organizations balance innovation with risk management in AI development?

3. What role should different stakeholders (technical teams, business units, legal, ethics committees) play in AI risk management?

4. How should organizations approach the challenge of identifying unknown or emerging risks in AI systems?

5. What are the limitations of current AI risk management frameworks, and how might they be improved?

### AI Governance

1. How should responsibilities for AI governance be distributed across an organization?

2. What are the challenges in implementing global AI governance frameworks in organizations that operate across multiple jurisdictions?

3. How can organizations effectively translate high-level ethical principles into practical governance mechanisms?

4. What role should external stakeholders (customers, communities, regulators) play in organizational AI governance?

5. How might AI governance approaches need to evolve as AI capabilities continue to advance?

## Interactive Activities

### Activity 1: AI Risk Assessment Exercise

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes

**Format**: Small groups of 3-5 participants

**Description**: 
1. Each group is assigned a hypothetical AI application (e.g., an AI hiring system, a medical diagnosis tool, a credit scoring algorithm)
2. Groups identify potential risks across categories (technical, ethical, legal, reputational)
3. Groups assess likelihood and impact for each risk
4. Groups propose mitigation strategies for high-priority risks
5. Groups present their top three risks and mitigation strategies to the larger audience

**Materials Needed**: Worksheets with risk assessment template, scenario descriptions

### Activity 2: Governance Framework Design

**Duration**: 30-40 minutes

**Format**: Small groups of 3-5 participants

**Description**:
1. Groups are tasked with designing a governance framework for a specific organization type (healthcare provider, financial institution, government agency, technology company)
2. Groups must define:
   - Key governance roles and responsibilities
   - Decision-making processes for AI projects
   - Oversight mechanisms
   - Reporting and documentation requirements
3. Groups create a visual representation of their governance framework
4. Groups present their frameworks and explain their design choices

**Materials Needed**: Large paper or digital whiteboard, markers, template with key governance elements

### Activity 3: Case Study Analysis

**Duration**: 25-35 minutes

**Format**: Individual reflection followed by group discussion

**Description**:
1. Participants read a detailed case study of an AI implementation that encountered challenges
2. Individually, participants identify:
   - What went wrong
   - What could have been done differently
   - Which management, risk, or governance practices could have prevented issues
3. In small groups, participants compare their analyses
4. Full group discussion of key lessons and best practices

**Materials Needed**: Printed case studies with discussion questions

### Activity 4: Ethical Dilemma Scenarios

**Duration**: 20-30 minutes

**Format**: Full group discussion or small breakout groups

**Description**:
1. Presenter introduces a scenario involving an ethical dilemma in AI development or deployment
2. Participants discuss how they would approach the dilemma, considering:
   - Different stakeholder perspectives
   - Applicable ethical principles
   - Potential governance mechanisms to address similar situations
3. If using breakout groups, each group reports their conclusions
4. Presenter summarizes different approaches and connects to governance frameworks

**Materials Needed**: Scenario descriptions, ethical principles reference sheet

### Activity 5: AI Governance Maturity Assessment

**Duration**: 15-20 minutes

**Format**: Individual assessment with group discussion

**Description**:
1. Participants complete a self-assessment of their organization's AI governance maturity
2. Assessment covers key dimensions:
   - Leadership and strategy
   - Policies and standards
   - Risk management processes
   - Training and awareness
   - Monitoring and compliance
3. Participants identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement
4. Voluntary sharing of insights and group discussion of common challenges

**Materials Needed**: Maturity assessment worksheets, scoring guide

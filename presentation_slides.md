# Section 3: AI Risk Management

---

## Understanding AI-Specific Risks

- AI risks differ from traditional technology risks
- Can be characterized as:
  - Long-term or short-term
  - High or low probability
  - Systemic or localized
  - High or low impact
- Emerge from complex interactions between technical and social factors

---

## Risk Management Frameworks

- **NIST AI Risk Management Framework**:
  - Govern: Establish governance structures
  - Map: Identify and document contexts and risks
  - Measure: Quantify and qualify AI risks
  - Manage: Implement mitigation strategies
- **ISO/IEC Standards**:
  - ISO/IEC 23894: AI Risk Management
  - ISO/IEC 42001: AI Management Systems

---

## Risk Identification Methods

# UNESCO AI Ethics and Governance Framework

## Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory

UNESCO has established the Global AI Ethics and Governance Observatory as a global resource for policymakers, regulators, academics, the private sector, and civil society to find solutions to the most pressing challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence. The Observatory:

- Showcases information about the readiness of countries to adopt AI ethically and responsibly
- Hosts the AI Ethics and Governance Lab, which gathers contributions, impactful research, toolkits, and good practices
- Provides resources to help ensure AI technologies develop with strong ethical guardrails

## Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence

UNESCO produced the first-ever global standard on AI ethics â€“ the 'Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence' in November 2021, applicable to all 194 member states of UNESCO.

### Core Values

The Recommendation is built on four core values:

1. **Human rights and human dignity**: Respect, protection, and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms
2. **Living in peaceful, just, and interconnected societies**
3. **Ensuring diversity and inclusiveness**
4. **Environment and ecosystem flourishing**

### Ten Core Principles

The Recommendation outlines ten core principles that lay out a human rights-centered approach to AI ethics:

1. **Proportionality and Do No Harm**: AI use must not exceed what's necessary to achieve legitimate aims
2. **Safety and Security**: Unwanted harms and vulnerabilities should be avoided
3. **Right to Privacy and Data Protection**: Privacy must be protected throughout the AI lifecycle
4. **Multi-stakeholder and Adaptive Governance & Collaboration**: Diverse stakeholder participation is necessary for inclusive AI governance
5. **Responsibility and Accountability**: AI systems should be auditable and traceable
6. **Transparency and Explainability**: The level of transparency should be appropriate to the context
7. **Human Oversight and Determination**: AI systems should not displace ultimate human responsibility
8. **Sustainability**: AI technologies should be assessed against their impacts on sustainability goals
9. **Awareness & Literacy**: Public understanding of AI should be promoted through education and training
10. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: AI actors should promote social justice and take an inclusive approach

### Implementation Tools

UNESCO has developed two practical methodologies to help implement the Recommendation:

1. **Readiness Assessment Methodology (RAM)**: Helps assess whether Member States are prepared to effectively implement the Recommendation
2. **Ethical Impact Assessment (EIA)**: A structured process to help AI project teams evaluate ethical implications
